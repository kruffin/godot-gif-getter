# Godot Gif Getter
An ingame utility for recording and saving gifs for Godot.

This utility is not very performant even with multiple threads. However, you do get the ability to create gifs without the use of an external program.

Makes use of [godot-gdgifexporter](https://github.com/jegor377/godot-gdgifexporter) for gif creation.

Inspired by [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/lv7pon/not_for_a_game_but_i_made_a_short_animation_using/).

## Quickstart
Add `addons/godot-gif-getter/GifGetterUI.tscn` to your scene. Click on the 'Capture now' button in the top left corner. Wait for the gif to be processed and saved.
